# A Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Custom Copilot Powered by Code Llama Model #

Custom Copilot is an application that employs state-of-the-art AI and large language models to assist users with complex cognitive tasks. It allows organizations to construct bespoke intelligent, conversational app experiences for their users, tailored to specific domains and unique pain points. Essentially, itâ€™s like having your very own AI copilot to help navigate the complexities of tasks and interactions!

Lets build CodeBuddy a custom copilot powered by Code Llama, a leading AI platform for code generation and analysis. the custom Copilot integrates Azure AI Content Safety, a feature that detects and prevents harmful or inappropriate content. the copilot helps you with code completion and Infilling.
